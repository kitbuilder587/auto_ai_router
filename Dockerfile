# Go runtime tuning defaults — overridable via env in the actual deployment
# manifest (e.g. if a pod's memory limit differs from the value assumed here).
#
# GOGC=300: let the heap triple (default is double, GOGC=100) before a GC
# cycle runs. Fewer/larger GC cycles trade RAM for CPU, which pays off here
# because pods are CPU-bound (GOMAXPROCS auto-tracks limits.cpu via cgroup
# quota since Go 1.25) while memory has headroom between requests.memory and
# limits.memory.
ENV GOGC=300
# GOMEMLIMIT=1700MiB: soft cap for the Go runtime's own memory use, tuned for
# a 2Gi container memory limit (~85%, leaving room for goroutine stacks and
# other non-heap RSS). As live heap approaches this, GC runs more aggressively
# to stay under it — turning a would-be abrupt OOMKill into graceful, bounded
# GC pressure instead. This is what makes GOGC=300 safe to run.
